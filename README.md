Social Media Appilcation with React and Material UI

The social media application was built using the React Library in JavaScript. The material UI was used to make the user interaction better. The social media shows the number of friends the user has and the posts made by the user. The EXTROPOST has a sidebar on the left side of the screen which shows the liked posts, friend's profiles and other features.
